Innovative initiative we developed during **the StartupFest 2018 Hackathon** to **tackle cancer treatment and prevention**.

Our website uses a deep learning model (conv_net.py is a brief demo, full code available upon request) to accurately identify different types of skin disease, and subsequently proposes personalized treatment and reccomends convenient doctors.
